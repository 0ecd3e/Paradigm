Unlike if - else statements, switches are used to evaluate expression that are of non-binary nature, that is, more than two different possibility of what the outcome will be. Switches have one expression and for each possibility of the expression will be a corresponding case. These cases contain code that will be executed if the outcome of the expression matches with the case itself. The switch may also have a default case if the outcome matches none of the other cases, but its inclusion is completely optional. The code block of each case must also include a break statement to ensure the program exits the switch. An example of a switch is as follows:

\n              switch( x ) {
\n                      case 1: x = x + 1;
\n                              break;
\n                      case 2: x = x + 2;
\n                              break;
\n                      case 3: x = x + 3;
\n                              break;
\n                      default: break;
\n              }
