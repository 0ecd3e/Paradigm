Primitive Types:
\nJava, like other programming languages, supports a variety of primitive data types. Primitive refers to the fact that it can not be further reduced into a more low level data type and rather than created by the programmer, is built into the language itself. The following provides a list of more common data types used.

\n      int: stores whole numbers only with size of 32 bit, is signed (can represent negative and non-negative numbers).
\n      long: same purpose as int but with increased size of 64 bit.
\n      float: stores decimal numbers with size of 32 bit with up to 7 digits of precision.
\n      double: same purpose as float with with increased size of 64 bit and improved precision of 16 digits.
\n      boolean: can only store one of two possible values. True or false.
\n      char: stores a single character using different representation standards such as ASCII or unicode.
