Java, like other programming languages, supports a variety of primitive data types. Primitive refers to the fact that it can not be further reduced into a more low level data type and rather than created by the programmer, is built into the language itself. The following provides a list of more common data types used.

\n
\n      int:  stores whole numbers only with
\n            size of 32 bit, is signed (can
\n            represent negative and
\n            non-negative numbers).
\n      long:same purpose as int but with
\n            increased size of 64 bit.
\n      float: stores decimal numbers with
\n             size of 32 bit with up to 7
\n             digits of precision.
\n      double: same purpose as float with
\n              increased size of 64 bit and
\n              improved precision of 16 digits.
\n      boolean: can only store one of two
\n              possible values. True or false.
\n      char:  stores a single character using
\n             different representation
\n             standards such as ASCII or
\n             unicode.
